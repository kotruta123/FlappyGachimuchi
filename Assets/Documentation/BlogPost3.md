### Feature 5
Move the background and add a image of it.

## I have added:
For making this nimation i have dubled the background. I have created a script that generates a new background image when the previous background image ends to a specified xPosition.
### Bug
The background doesnt generates frequently and appears new artifacts.
### Solution
In the game directory i created new main file that will store the background and atach to it the respective scripts. Also i have have addedd correct x axes where the background must start and finish. I have tried a lot of methods of how to do it and in the end i found the solution.
