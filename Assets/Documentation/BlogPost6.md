### Feature 1
The key controlls with gamepad

### I have added: 
I have added the key bindings to the respective pressent buttons to interact the game;
### Bug and partial solution
I have encountered a problem with interacting the gamepad buttons, before i have tried to add anothe input manager, but just two buttons worked, then i have added the package from the itslearning lesson, but it didnt work, i have spent about 5 days of finding how to solve it and i couldnt. For now it is possible just to jump on the game and also the restart game button, but others doesnt work. I have tried many different ways, but i couldnt face this problem.

### Reflection
During the developing period i have faced a lot of bugs and problems with the UI of Unity, it doesnt work properlywith small things. I had many issues with the scrip attachments to the game objects in the yeararchy of the project, alsowith the actal scripts code. I debugged a lot.  I have lost much time on it. But in the end i almost made all the necessary mechanics that i wanted to have. Also, i had many problems with WebGL build format. 99% of time the project was in this build platform and i couldnt get the product i wanted in the end. I have tried to fix it but in the end i coludnt. I have spent also 4 days to fix it and it wasnt possible. In the end i have decided to switch the build platform to Windows and it worked. the project run perfectly. The video made to show the functionality of the game is in Windows platform build. I didnt have any options. But in the end i think so that i am proud of this project, i have learned a lot of new things while developing the game.
