### Feature 1
Since from the begining it was in mind to create something very funny. But i have started with making the base of the project. I was decided to not use Unit assets, because it was supoused to show the ability to create a game from 0. It is suposed to be a game in a gachimuchi style. To show some popular memes.
### Before this
I have Installed the necessary Unity Editor to develop the game and chose the platform WebGL for building the project. After that:

### I have added: 
Some pictures that will serve as a background for better user atmosphere during the game.

### Feature 2
It was decided to create a simple menu, wth the buttons on it.

### I have added:
The button Play was added, wich will be able to redirect straight forward to the game. Also I have added a Info button to show some informator about me, because i am the creator of this game. After that i have added the Settings button to go to the settings page, and it was decided that player in setting will be able to reduce and maximize the volume of the background music and the SFX sounds.

### Feature 3
One more feature will be to create the Scenes, where the player will be able to access.

### I have added:
It was suposed to be four scenes in total: the main menu scene is nr.0, the actual game is scene nr.1, the settings scene is nr.2, and the info scene has the nr.3. I have put them in a list and sorted in the project settings.

### Feature 4
I wanted to add the background to the respective scenes
### I have added+bug:
I have added them, but i encountered some errors with the screen size and it has overflow the buttons.
### Bug Fix
I have searched on youtube tutorials how to do it better, and i have fownd that i have to create one element, best is a picture in canvas and the add it, but not straight forward to the project yerarchy.
